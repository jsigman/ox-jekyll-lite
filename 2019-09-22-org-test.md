Here's some text that lives above the top level header. Note that the header, and
equations, won't render nicely in GitHub, because this is Jekyll markdown, not Github
markdown.


# Top Level Header

Here's some text under the first header.

how about <u>underlined stuff</u> 

how about *italicized stuff*

how about **bolded stuff**

How about footnotes?[^fn1] 


## What about rendering math?

Here's an equation:

\\[ \oint\_z f(z) \, dz \\]

Here's some inline math: \\(f(x) = x \log (x)\\).


# Does code work?

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(10))  
```

```bash
ls -alFh
echo "emacs rocks"
```

What happens to results from an `org-babel` session?

```python
import numpy as np
min(np.sin(x) for x in np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)) 
```

They don't get rendered. That's OK for now - ultimately, it would be nice to have them
render (including images).

# TODO <code>[7/7]</code>

Schedules get ignored, which is correct. Can schedule or deadline parts of the post if
you want to.

-   [X] Fix underlining things
-   [X] Fix links
-   [X] **Fix equation delimiter rendering**
-   [X] Ignore `ltximg` directories
-   [X] Get preamble export working
    -   [X] Pass subtitle in as excerpt
    -   [X] Set category as "post", don't set layout
-   [X] Get footnotes exporting properly
-   [X] Make images export properly.


# TODO Eventually

-   [ ] Have `RESULTS` blocks from org-babel render in some nice way
-   [ ] Minor mode that exports whenever I save, as long as I'm in `_drafts` or `_posts`.
-   [ ] set `OPTIONS: comments:nil` and it will appear in the yaml front-matter
