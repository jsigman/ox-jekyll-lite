Basic idea is to rework [ox-jekyll](~/.emacs.d/lisp/ox-jekyll-md/ox-jekyll-md.el) to fit my purposes. It's derived from ox-md which is
derived from ox-html.

[ox-jekyll source code](https://github.com/gonsie/ox-jekyll-md)

[ox-md source code](https://github.com/emacsmirror/org/blob/master/lisp/ox-md.el)

[ox-html source code](https://github.com/emacsmirror/org/blob/master/lisp/ox-html.el)


# TODO <code>[7/7]</code>

Schedules get ignored, which is correct. Can schedule or deadline parts of the post if
you want to.

-   [X] Fix underlining things
-   [X] Fix links
-   [X] **Fix equation delimiter rendering**
-   [X] Ignore `ltximg` directories
-   [X] Get preamble export working
    -   [X] Pass subtitle in as excerpt
    -   [X] Set category as "post", don't set layout
-   [X] Get footnotes exporting properly
-   [X] Make images export properly.


# TODO Eventually

-   [ ] Have `RESULTS` blocks from org-babel render in some nice way
-   [ ] Minor mode that exports whenever I save, as long as I'm in `_drafts` or `_posts`.
-   [ ] set `OPTIONS: comments:nil` and it will appear in the yaml front-matter


## Fixing Images

Right now they just get treated like any other link. Also, the link gets prepended with
a full path, beginning with `file://`, which is *not* what we want; we just want the
<u>relative</u> path from here to the image. What if I just type that in directly?

Well, it's actually kind of complicated. What I really want to do is to have a function
that looks at links and strips them down to absolute paths, when appropriate.

Okay so take a look at `ox-hugo-link` ([code here](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/blob/master/ox-hugo.el#L1963)) for an example of a function that parses
links. We want something much simpler - it should check whether the link is an image,
and prepend an `!` if so; also, it should look at the path and determine how to strip it
down to the appropriate relative path so that it treats the jekyll root like the true
root.


## Fixing Equations

Look through [the code for ox-html](https:github.com/emacsmirror/org/blob/master/lisp/ox-html.el) and search for "latex" to find the parts where they
render latex. It's pretty complicated, which makes sense. We just need to change the
delimiters it uses.


## Fixing links

I need to go digging through the section where it generates links. I want to set up a
thing that specifically handles http links in there.

UPDATE: Actually, you can just write your links as `https://` instead of `https:`, and then
it works fine. I will start doing this in general, I think.


# Blogging in Org!

use `ox-jekyll`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/gonsie/ox-jekyll-md).

but I need to redefine the way it exports equations

So I change the `translate-alist` to include something additional for equations. But I
don't know how to figure out the right "key" for a latex chunk, and how to get its
contents. I need to better understand what the `translate-alist` is actually doing.

second level shit

how about <u>underlined stuff</u> 

how about *italicized stuff*

how about **bolded stuff**

How about footnotes?[^fn1] 


## Here's some content

third level shit

[here's a link](https://google.com)

Here's an equation:

\\[ x = \sum\_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n \log n}\right) \\]

Here's some inline math: \\(x = y^2\\).


# Does code work?

```python
import numpy as np
np.min(x for x in range(10))  
```

```bash
ls -alFh
pip list | grep lachesis
```

```python
import numpy as np
min(np.sin(x) for x in np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)) 
```


# Here's a table

| Name | Age | Phone |
|---|---|---|
| Peter Wills | 31 | 585 |
| Kathleen Finlinson | 29 | 435 |

Okay looks pretty good there.


# Images?
