Here's some text that lives above the top level header.

* Top Level Header

Here's some text under the first header.

how about _underlined stuff_ 

how about /italicized stuff/

how about *bolded stuff*

How about footnotes?[fn:1] 

** What about rendering math>

Here's an equation:

$$ \oint_z f(z) \, dz $$

Here's some inline math: $f(x) = x \log (x)$.

* Does code work?

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(10))  
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls -alFh
echo "emacs rocks"
#+END_SRC

What happens to results from an =org-babel= session?

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :async t :results drawer :session
import numpy as np
min(np.sin(x) for x in np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)) 
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[3]:
: -0.9998741276738751
:END:

They don't get rendered. That's OK for now - ultimately, it would be nice to have them
render (including images).

* TODO [7/7]
SCHEDULED: <2019-09-21 Sat>

Schedules get ignored, which is correct. Can schedule or deadline parts of the post if
you want to.

- [X] Fix underlining things
- [X] Fix links
- [X] *Fix equation delimiter rendering*
- [X] Ignore =ltximg= directories
- [X] Get preamble export working
  - [X] Pass subtitle in as excerpt
  - [X] Set category as "post", don't set layout
- [X] Get footnotes exporting properly
- [X] Make images export properly. 

* TODO Eventually

- [ ] Have =RESULTS= blocks from org-babel render in some nice way
- [ ] Minor mode that exports whenever I save, as long as I'm in =_drafts= or =_posts=.
- [ ] set =OPTIONS: comments:nil= and it will appear in the yaml front-matter

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Schwink!
